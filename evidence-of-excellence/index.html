    <h1>Evidence of Excellence</h1>
    <p>I want to create a meaningful impact in the world, and I've wanted to since I was little.</p>
    <p>At 18, I felt very frustrated with the college application system. I came from a suburban town of Minneapolis where I had no clue growing up that you had to do research with a college professor, or win ISEF, or be a medalist at an olympiad to get into a great college.</p>
    <p>Instead I moved to California on my own, got into a bootcamp (&lt;1% acceptance rate) that gave me a $2,000 stipend each month to learn to code and set up interviews for its cohorts. I then interned at Indeed.com for 6 months and built an internal product for PMs. After Indeed, I worked at the Center for Microgrid Research. I learned C++ in less than a month and coded translation software for devices to seamlessly get added to a microgrid in a combat scenario (the grant I am working on is funded by the US Army).</p>
    <p>Some things I like: Biking, chessboxing, and two-player bughouse. I woke up April 21st of 2023 and decided to bike around the Bay, all three bridges. It took me 7 hours, and I biked 40 miles. One time I crashed my bike in front of a kickboxing gym and decided to sign up for 6 months. On January 23rd 2023 I decided to create the rules for, and code my own social deception game. 12 people played it using an app I made at a social later that night.</p>
    <p>I am determined and curious. I really like learning. What drives me is being around a community of people who strive for excellence and have a clear mission. I joined the Space Force ROTC program for a year. I found out two weeks ago that I can't continue because I have an allergy to nuts. However, in that time, I built a chatbot with Air Force documents and used Zilliz and the OpenAI embedding model to make an app for cadets to quickly recall how to do marching movements, remember ranks, and know when to salute.</p>
    <p>I've been inspired by Elon and his vision for his companies since I was 15. I want to see robots in homes, carrying groceries from people's cars into their houses, tutoring kids with homework, and integrating advanced AI into our lives.</p>
    <p>My excellence comes from my agency and persistence. I can push myself to the limit, physically and mentally. Whether it's cross-country skiing 100 kilometers for 8 hours straight on a two-mile loop, or coding for 26 hours straight in a hackathon (where I ran a mile every hour, and coded a 2-player version of Conway's Game of Life during the rest of the time), I love rewarding challenges.</p>
